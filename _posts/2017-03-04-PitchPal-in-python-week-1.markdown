**Target - set up working environment**

This may seem like an easy target to reach *however* as well as my appendix exploding I have also had a complete OS meltdown. On the brighter side of things, it has enabled me to reach one of my initial goals to be [actively working in a linux environment]({% post_url 2017-01-24-tools %}). So I now have Pycharm and Kivy set up and working in Linux, and finally a working [GitHub integration](https://github.com/phlillip/PitchPal), though this has to be done via the command line at present.

I am confident I can now move onto my second goal of creating my app structure; by this I am referring to having pages and navigation built out which I can then populate with functionality. Of course, having never built an app before, I may be going about this in the wrong order; experience and time will show me but for now I am following the most logical order I can for an app that I already have the general designs for.

Having said this, I believe it is important to have the designs in front of me whilst I am working, so I will quickly generate some medium-fidelty visuals of the pages and how the user flows between them so I can always see what I am aiming for.
