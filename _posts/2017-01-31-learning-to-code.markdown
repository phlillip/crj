**The abundance of choice created by the the internet leads to a new problem in decision making &mdash; where do I start?**

For **years** I have pondered how to get into programming, that is ultimately what led me to this course. Understanding the variety of languages available is a skill in itself, let alone the ways in which you can consume the information.

My first approach was to work through the free Python course over on codecademy. This interactive method of learning has numerous benefits &mdash; no need to worry about system configurations or install, you begin programming immediately with structured exercises that are short so it's easy to dip in and out of the program.

However, it's downfall is exactly it's benefit &mdash; to write a working application you do first need to understand how to set up your development environment to be able to build one and test it. Everything I do in codecademy has the feeling of "hypothetical" work, none of it actually exists.

After many hours in codecademy I feel it is time to begin coding for real &mdash; as basic as it needs to be to start with &mdash; just so long as I am producing an end result.

Here begins the era of Pycharm &hellip;
