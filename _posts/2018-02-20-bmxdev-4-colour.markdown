**My recent visit to [Scotland](https://www.google.com/maps?q=loc:56.2668133,-4.2855067) placed me in some of the most natural scenery I could imagine, so I chose this photograph I took of my first ever experience of a Loch.**

I decided to try out some services that automatically extract a  colour palette from images to help me get started, and found that [Canva](https://www.canva.com/color-palette/) provided the best results.

This natural colour palette does form a complementary colour scheme, with the pair of colours Sienna (#9C7c44) and Light Steel Blue (#96B0CD) most closely fiting this scheme. Sienna stands alone on the opposite side of the colour wheel so is an ideal choice to be used an the accent colour. The remaining colours are all very similar to each other&mdash;too much so to be classed as analogous&mdash;with Dark Slate Gray (#48536B) being the most saturated of these. This therefore can be used effectively as the dominant colour.
