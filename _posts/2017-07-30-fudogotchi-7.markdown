**BLE proves a step too far as the scope of the project is re-assessed.**

Having worked so hard during the planning and presentation stages of this project, I feel disappointed with my progress over the past two weeks. I have struggled to maintain the momentum and can only put it down to exhaustion.

This would suggest that our planning stage was overly ambitious and not sustainable. It's easy to get carried away with an idea, especially considering the scope of many modern apps. Lesson learned; we have re-adressed our plans, with good feedback from Carl who has recommended we drop the Bluetooth stretch goal due to time constraints.
