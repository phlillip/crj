**Target - create app functionality**

My SMART goal this week was far too big, so unsurprisingly I didn't manage to complete it. I devoted many hours to the application, building up the functionality step by step, but having a working app already meant I didn't follow my user stories as well as I should, to the extent that I actually created additional functionality before completing all the basic goals.

Again I had [help from Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42841321/return-id-of-button-when-clicked-kivy-python) and I have to admit that I don't fully understand the solution, but I did manage to apply it to my application and that is good enough for me for now. It is difficult learning Python & Kivy at the same time, they are essentially two different languages that need to be applied in their own way. I don't think I will fully get a grasp of the best way to build until I have completed a few more applications in different areas, perhaps a game app would be useful to improve my understanding.

Yet again I have failed to produce design mockups&mdash;this is due to the huge number of hours I ploughed into coding this week. However, the goal in the 4th week is to beautify the app so I will definitely need some visuals to aim for. My user stories:

* As the purchaser, I want the app to look professional and uniform throughout so I feel like I am buying a quality product.
* As the manager, I want to know where I am in the app so I can quickly and easily navigate to different areas without missing the game.
