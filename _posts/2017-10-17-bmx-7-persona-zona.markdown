##Scenario

Paul Perkins' young son is mad on BMX, so he takes him down to the new wheeled hub on Saturday mornings for the “Daddy café”. While his son is having lessons on the BMX track, he sits and drinks his coffee and looks for ways to pass the time.

Spotting an advert on the café wall, he accesses the PWA for the original pump track on his mobile phone and begins interacting with it. Paul has been a local resident his entire life yet he had no idea of the history surrounding him. He has a lot to tell his son about when he returns!

He scans the AR markers on his coffee table through the app, and sees something come to life right before his eyes. Thirsty for more, he heads outside to the location of the original pump track and holds up his phone&hellip;

a 3D model of the original pump track is there, in full size in the original location. Mr Perkins walks around the field, analysing the turns and jumps. He remembers this from his own childhood!

Later on that evening he tells his friends and family of his experience during a meal in a restaurant, some of them are local too and can't wait to get down to the pump track to experience it for themselves.
