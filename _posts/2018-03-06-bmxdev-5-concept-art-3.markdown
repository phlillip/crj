**Using familiar tools.**

Having found joy using Illustrator and a mouse, I attempted to redo my concept art with a Wacom tablet and Illustrator. I started again from the (unlicensed) sample [[1]](#ref) in order to gain correct proportions and aspect ratios.

I sketched the figure outline from the photo as simplistically as I could using the Wacom.

Next, I created a custom brush in Illustrator, and used it to refine my lines (with the reference photo hidden) giving the man a baseball cap.

I then imported my historical photograph onto the tablet, and used the "image trace" tool to stylise it and limit the colours to just 16. These colours would then be used to paint in my figure. Finally I added my photograph of the current starting grid as a background and again used image trace, this time with only 12 colours to create a contrast between what exists and what went before.

</figure>

The style I have adopted here is a very basic, sketched approach that ideally should be used for earlier stages of development. If I had the time I would like to refine the image and add in further lighting and shading, and more importantly, show the viewer exactly what the purpose of this image is. I feel at the moment the message is being lost, all the user can see is a person watching a video on a tablet.
