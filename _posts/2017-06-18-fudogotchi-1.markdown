**33% of our resources lost before we even started**

One-third of our team quit this week&mdash;the first week of the project&mdash;meaning we are suddenly facing an entire group project with just a two man team. This has several implications.

##Planning

Planning suddenly becomes ever more important. It is critical we do not waste time at any stage of this project. Conversely, communication and organisation becomes easier due to there only being a single direct channel to be concerned with; me < > Carl. 

##Skillset

The opportunities to spread ourselves thinly across various disciplines has now gone. In order to achieve anywhere near the level we wish to be at, we need to focus on our strengths and divide the work up accordingly.

##Scope

We need to reign in our creativity somewhat and accept that some ideas will just be dreams now we effectively have lost 3 weeks' worth of the project contribution.
