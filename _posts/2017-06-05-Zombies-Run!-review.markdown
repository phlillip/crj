##An initial look at the GPS running app Zombies, Run!

[Zombies, Run!](https://zombiesrungame.com/) is developed by [Six to Start](http://www.sixtostart.com). This is a review of version 6.1.0 for Android, free with in-app purchases available. It aims to encourage exercise by using live GPS to deliver an audio storyline whilst the user is running (or walking).

I put myself in the shoes of someone who does not care how an app works, or understands how to overcome any UX issues; so I downloaded it and immediately went out for a run. I'm pleased to say it improved my running experience, and really put me on edge. Even during the silence (I neglected to set up my music playlist for the gaps inbetween story segements) I was second-guessing myself as to whether or not the birds I could hear were the app or actual wildlife around me.

The ecosystem behind this app is huge&mdash;there are already 6 seasons' worth of storyline to run through, along with challenges targeted to specific workouts, an online profile tracker  as well as a complete RPG town building element using items you "collect" whilst running. I feel it needs another review in a month's time once I have been able to fully digest all the features.

The app does have the obvious drawbacks of having to carry a mobile phone and headphones whilst jogging, but I will definitely use it again&mdash;the miles flies by, making running long distances less daunting.
