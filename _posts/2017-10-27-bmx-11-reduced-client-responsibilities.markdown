**When client communication doesn't proceed as you had planned, it is important to re-evaluate the roles and responsibilities.**

I had initially hoped to integrate my work with the current funding application process as tightly as possible. This would mean meeting with the consultation company handling the rest of the bid, speaking to other council employees related to this field and including many people in my design process.

Unfortunately I have had very little client contact since our first, extremely positive an exciting meeting at the very start of October. I have now reached a point where I can no longer rely on input and resources from my client in order to reach a successful conclusion; therefore I have decided to reduce their role in order to get things done.

I will drive the design and build independently, ensuring I keep my client up to date with progress and explaining my decisions, but also guiding them as to the path I will be taking and why. They will still have an opportunity to offer their opinion on what they think is important and what isn't, but I will insist upon direction regarding any such comments within 1 or 2 working days for it to be considered.
