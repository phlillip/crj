##Why use progressive web apps?

The reasons are three-fold:

1. Budget&mdash;moving forward, only one application needs to be written and maintained that will serve as both website *and* application. Always live, always up to date.
2. Skills&mdash;personally it puts lets pressure on me to develop my programming knowledge for native apps, so I can spend more time designing a well thought out product. HTML & CSS are already in my arsenal, Javascript is getting there.
3. Exposure&mdash;everyone has a web browser on their smartphone. No need to download an app to experience the product, and no need to update the app periodically. Saves the user time, and storage space on their phone.
