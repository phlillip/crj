**The council now consider me as a key stakeholder in the project.**

Having had only my second meeting with my client since the start of the project, my responsibilities and focus have now changed. The council have attained internal funding for the regeneration of the track, but are still pushing for funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. I have been told of my importance to the project, and have begun negotiations to extend development into the next module, in line with the scheduled April 2018 bid.

It is now clear that I can have a significant influence on the project, and the future of the facility in the town, with the opportunity to leave a lasting artefact for future generations. This requires me to look beyond the December deadline and consider my approach to branding the site as a whole, as well as the opportunity for marketing and even the track design itself.
