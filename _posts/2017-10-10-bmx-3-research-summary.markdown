**What follows is a summary of my research to date.**

###The competition

[The Heritage Lottery Fund](https://www.hlf.org.uk/) accepts applications nationwide, and has a wide variety of grants and funding schemes. I need to find out the type of application Redditch Borough Council is planning on making, to understand more about what needs to be highlighted. One immediate takeaway is the focus on *heritage* in all support schemes.

###Users

In my meeting with Jackie we spoke about making the area as open and welcoming as possible, to encourage families to bring their children. The close proximity of the new BMX track already pulls in a subset of users that would easily identify as users of the pump track, but this would also extend to the younger, less experienced riders and general public. Health and safety regulations also need to be considered.

###Features

A [progressive web app](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) appears to be a logical route to take to deliver an economic and wide-reaching solution. It also ties in with my current skillset, so lends itself to faster development times.

An initial analysis into the use of augmented reality with progressive web apps has proved positive; with just two caveats to consider:

1. Further investigation ito *markerless* AR needs to be done to enable GPS-based AR.
2. [Certain browsers](http://caniuse.com/rtcpeerconnection/embed/) are unable to take advantage of the technology. An approximation would deem this to be around 35% of web browsers, or a third. More analysis is needed.

###Costings

The only budget involed here is my time; up to 12 weeks of university study during the module, plus some additional voluntary time available in Q1 of 2018 to help further improve the proposal.
