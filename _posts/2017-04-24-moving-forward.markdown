**Moving forward**

I started this course with the primary aim of becoming an able programmer; even if all I achieved was some resemblence of fluency in a programming language then I could consider it money well spent. As it turns out, even this introductory module has been enormously beneficial to me on my coding journey&mdash;it is always the start that is the hardest and this term I have not only got deeply involved in Python programming, but I am on the verge of releasing my first app.

This effort comes at a cost however; my reading has definitely been neglected along with my studies into the creative side of things. Luckily I had already planned for this&mdash;the whole of May can be used to work out the fine details of my app along with catching up on my reading.

I have also neglected my GitHub account, I need to begin using this as a course of habit during my programming sessions. I believe this has been affected by my transition over to the Linux operating system, because I have had to learn a lot of new systems of practice.

**My SMART objective**

I'm going to read at least 4 books from my reading list so that I can ensure I have covered all areas of the course. To achieve this I'm going to commit at least 10 hours per week during the 4 weeks in May, reviewing each piece of literature I cover in the form of a blog post. I am also going to make a final decision on the direction I will take concerning data handling in my PitchPal app.
