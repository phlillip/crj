**I am in a slightly different position for this brief of providing a solution for another solution.**

The purpose of this project is to "Form part of a local council bid&hellip;" which leaves me in a slightly complex position regarding the creation of my user stories. Should I be aiming to meet the requirements of the bid, or what the bid is aiming to achieve?

Further consideration into who my users are has forced me to focus in on what it is I am actually doing. I have spent a lot of time in "analysis paralysis", daydreaming about all the possible outcomes of this project and how I can reign these thoughts in and apply them to the agile process. I did not put my thoughts out there to my peers or tutor to gain their feedback on the matter early on. Contact with my client is proving to be slow so I was unable to gain a response.

This has cost me a lot of time, but it has now put me on a path which will be productive and efficient, even if it changes over the forthcoming sprints. I understand that I need to focus on the users of _my_ product, not that of the council's. If they decide not to use my app as part of their bid, I should design it in such a way that it can be a standalone product. It would still be of great value to the town to have the heritage of the pump track documented and delivered in a compelling way. This will then only encourage interest and provide benefits for future bid applications.

I hit a brick wall of thought during this process, moving into other areas before fully completing this section. Moving forward, I need to engage the help and support of my peers, tutors and client in order to come to a swifter conclusion.
