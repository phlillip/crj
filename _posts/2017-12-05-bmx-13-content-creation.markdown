**This all began in 1980. Nearly 40 years ago**

Amazingly, [Gerrit Does](http://universityofbmx.com) has kept a detailed chronology of his influential involvement in the introduction of BMX to Europe in the 1970's and 1980's. Included on his website is almost a play-by-play of the events that unfolded, complete with scanned documents and period photographs relating the the creation of the Redditch track.

This, along with potential contacts in [Julian Hammonds](http://www.jgh-concepts.co.uk/) and [Geoff Wiles](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Geoff_Wiles), and my client scouring the Council archives should reveal further pieces of information to populate the timeline.

A fantastic example of a timeline-style site is [Lance Stroll's](http://lancestroll.com/) personal website. The animation really brings it alive and has given me great inspiration for my app.
