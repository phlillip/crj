**For the individual design & development module I will be continuing my work on the BMX PWA ahead of the National Lottery Heritage Funding bid.**



### Sprint 1 - Presentation
*focus: game and narrative design*
 
I will focus on finalising the "brand" and implementing it throughout the app for both web and mobile. I will also finalise the content I have sourced and ensure it is presented professionally, with animations and graphics. 

### Sprint 2 - VR/AR
*focus: colour theory, concept art, character design*

Create 3D model(s) of the track and/or surrounding elements and fully implement them in AR. 

### Sprint 3 - BMX Builder

*focus: sound design and animation*

I intend to build something similar to this, using SVG graphics and javascript:

To allow users to design their own custom “old skool” BMX and demonstrate the e-commerce that could support this. 

### Sprint 4 - Optimisation

*focus: professional presentation*

The idea of this sprint is to take a look at my code and see where it can be rewritten in a better way to improve performance, maintainability etc.
