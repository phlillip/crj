**Estimating the work load using story points based on the fibonacci sequence.**

<img src="/media/2017-10-31/estimation.jpg" />

Having broken my roadmap down into various tasks, I found it extremely efficient to apply the methods suggested by Alcwyn in the course videos. It was a very quick process that backed up my initial plan and gave me the confidence to proceed.

Though I do have a few too many 5 point tasks, I am the sole developer so my flexible working means I can start on these early and concurrently with other tasks.
