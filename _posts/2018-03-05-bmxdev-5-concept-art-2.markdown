**Further investigations into concept art creation.**

After further practice with a Wacom tablet, I attempted again at concept art. Beginning with a recent photo of the old start grid:

<figure>
	<img src="/media/2018-03-05/2018-03-05_bg.jpg" />
	<figcaption>
		The start grid as it stands
	</figcaption>
</figure>

I then began sketching my figure over the top:

<figure>
	<img src="/media/2018-03-05/2018-03-05_sketch.jpg" />
	<figcaption>
		Sketching out the framework of my composition
	</figcaption>
</figure>

Next I blocked out the major components on separate layers:

<figure>
	<img src="/media/2018-03-05/2018-03-05_blocks.jpg" />
	<figcaption>
		Blocking out the components
	</figcaption>
</figure>

I then placed an old photo of the start grid onto the tablet and began sampling colours from it to use to light the scene:

<figure>
	<img src="/media/2018-03-05/2018-03-05_shaded.jpg" />
	<figcaption>
		Shading the scene
	</figcaption>
</figure>

Looking at this piece now, it appears as though the figure is in the dark so his colour palette needs work. It also lacks the style and finish of a piece of concept art. Perhaps I will get more accuracy through use of the pen tool or even by applying line smoothing.

Another thing I have learnt is that I need to add the layer shading on it's own separate layer so I can easily change the base colour of the components from the blues to more natural colours.
