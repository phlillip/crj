**With the heavy constraints and limitations imposed upon the project, the focus will lean slightly towards market over technology in a dual drive strategy, to deliver a professional end product that also has a wow factor achieved through its implementation.**

This project has no previous design allocated to it whatsoever, therefore I have to give this area at least equal dedication as the technology in order to deliver a professional product to meet the needs of the council.

It is imperative that I create a polished finished product; I will sacrifice features in order to achieve this if necessary. The project will potentially continue to run after the University deadline, so extra functionality can be added in later if requested.

With this in mind, I will create a highly stylised, themed PWA that transports the user back in time to the 1980's; this draws upon the unique character and history of the pump track and helps to distinguish it from it's newer counterpart, the BMX racing track a few metres away.
