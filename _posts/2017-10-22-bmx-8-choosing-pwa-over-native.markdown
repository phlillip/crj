**In the real world, deadlines are king. With this in mind, I have chosen to build a progressive web application (PWA) over a native app, or one built in a universal compiler program such as Unity.**

My technical competence in web development is already at a professional level, so this decision dramatically reduces the time it will take for me to complete my goals in this project. Not only that, but I believe a PWA to be a perfect fit for the council, who have to represent everybody. A PWA is truly universal, being an advanced website.

A PWA can also be managed much more efficiently than a native app, allowing for advantages such as automatically updating (without the need to go through an app store process or have the user download an update), having a single, very common codebase that can be maintained by a much wider range of developers (web development being a much less specific skill than certain individual programming languages), and reducing the need for the user to go through a download process before being able to experience the app.

I feel that as the sole developer on this project, I simply wouldn't be able to create a finished product that would reach publishable status if I were to try and learn new technologies in such a short space of time.
