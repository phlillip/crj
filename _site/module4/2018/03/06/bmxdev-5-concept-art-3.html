    <p><strong>Using familiar tools.</strong></p>

<p>Having found joy using Illustrator and a mouse, I attempted to redo my concept art with a Wacom tablet and Illustrator. I started again from the (unlicensed) sample <a href="#ref">[1]</a> in order to gain correct proportions and aspect ratios.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/media/2018-03-06/2018-03-06_concept-photo.jpg" />
	<figcaption>
		1) The reference image
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I sketched the figure outline from the photo as simplistically as I could using the Wacom.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="/media/2018-03-06/2018-03-06_concept-sketch.jpg" />
	<figcaption>
		2) Sketching out the main components of the image
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Next, I created a custom brush in Illustrator, and used it to refine my lines (with the reference photo hidden) giving the man a baseball cap.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/media/2018-03-06/2018-03-06_concept-inked.jpg" />
	<figcaption>
		3) Creating custom stylised lines
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I then imported my historical photograph onto the tablet, and used the “image trace” tool to stylise it and limit the colours to just 16. These colours would then be used to paint in my figure. Finally I added my photograph of the current starting grid as a background and again used image trace, this time with only 12 colours to create a contrast between what exists and what went before.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/media/2018-03-06/2018-03-06_concept-coloured.jpg" />
	<figcaption>
		4) Adding in photos and stylising them, creating a colour palette for the main figure.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The style I have adopted here is a very basic, sketched approach that ideally should be used for earlier stages of development. If I had the time I would like to refine the image and add in further lighting and shading, and more importantly, show the viewer exactly what the purpose of this image is. I feel at the moment the message is being lost, all the user can see is a person watching a video on a tablet.</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Phil Penny, based in the UK. I have a solid background in design and I have chosen to study this MA to improve my programming skills - I am currently in the situation whereby I can design anything that comes into my head but I cannot build it into a working application. By the end of this course I hope to have reached a point where I am self-sufficient, so I am able to put any ideas I have into practice from start to finish. This course is also a step on my journey into a potential future career as a lecturer or tutor.</p>

<p>You can view some of my previous work at <a href="http://philpenny.co.uk">philpenny.co.uk</a> or check out my personal blog at <a href="http://naturamohican.com">naturalmohican.com</a></p>
