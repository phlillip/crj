    <p><strong>By considering character design I have opened up a new avenue of promotion for my app.</strong></p>

<p>Creating a  character design for my app involves consideration of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Personality</li>
  <li>Location</li>
  <li>Colour</li>
  <li>Form</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="brainstorm">Brainstorm</h3>

<p>To begin exploring these factors I began with a brainstorm which eventually produced a novel way of integrating a character within the story of the app.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<h3 id="location">Location</h3>

<p>Whilst examining the location aspect of character design, it occurred to me that I could draw parallels between the character and the track itself. In it’s current state, the track is “dead”, so there is an opportunity to present the “spirit of the track” in the form of a ghostly character with an agenda to return the track to it’s former glory.</p>

<p>Is he a local resident, with an intricate knowledge of the town? This would enable him to connect with other developments in the park. He might be a former BMX pro rider from abroad who helped usher BMX into the UK for the very first time.</p>

<h3 id="personality">Personality</h3>

<p>The spirit is truly stuck in the 80’s; that is where his existence ended, so he is an embodiment of everything stereotypical of BMX in that decade - showing similar traits to the surfing community, his language would be era-specific with a positive outlook on life.</p>

<h3 id="colour">Colour</h3>

<p>As a spirit the character would have to fit his ghostly presence in with the bright colour palette of the app, yet as a live entity (which may be realised upon restoration of the pump track in real life) would be dressed in typical 80’s BMX attire.</p>

<p><strong>The Rose of Temperaments</strong></p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>We can examine Goethe and Schiller’s 200 year old Rose of Temperaments to understand common links between colours and personality types:</p>

<p>colours: red/orange/yellow<br />
temperament: choleric<br />
personality: independent, decisive, goal oriented<br />
character traits: tyrants, heroes, adventurers</p>

<p>colours: yellow/green/cyan<br />
temperament: sanguine<br />
personality: enthusiastic, active, and social<br />
character traits: hedonists, lovers, poets</p>

<p>colours: cyan/blue/violet<br />
temperament: phlegmatic<br />
personality: relaxed, peaceful, quiet<br />
character public speakers, historians, teachers</p>

<p>colours: violet/magenta/red<br />
temperament: melancholic<br />
personality: analytical, detail oriented, deep thinker and feeler <br />
character traits: philosophers, pedants, rulers</p>

<p>Following this theory would suggest a colour scheme hinted towards the choleric temperament of warm red oranges and yellows as our spirit is a hero trying to help resurrect the track. He is also adventurous in his interests of BMX riding.</p>

<p>However, in his spirit form he may also exhibit shades of one of the other temperaments depending upon the final decision of his mood - a sad spirit, or an active spirit.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/media/2018-03-03/2018-03-03_sonny.jpg" />

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Interestingly, a previous character creation project I worked on resulted in my character “Sonny”, a vampire who was afraid of the dark. His cape is a rich purple, demonstrably linking him with the phlegmatic temperament as he plays out his days in the loneliness of his castle, unable to go out into the dangerous sunlight nor the frightening darkness.</p>

<h3 id="form">Form</h3>

<p>Immediately a teenage form springs to mind, a human character that would have enjoyed using the track in it’s heyday. However, being a spirit, there exists some opportunity for time-saving creation techniques such as missing limbs (as exhibited famously by Rayman) and the constant presence of a helmet to simplify drawing of the head and facial features. This could also add a sense of mystery similar to Top Gear’s The Stig.</p>

<h3 id="existing-art">Existing art</h3>

<p>A brief study into existing BMX artwork heralds the obvious work by BMX entrepeneur Bob Haro, mostly for BMX Action magazine in the 1980’s.</p>

<p>I also found an excellent series of sketches on Artstation by <a href="https://www.artstation.com/jocelynmillet">Jocelyn Millet</a> that show great composition and style.</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Phil Penny, based in the UK. I have a solid background in design and I have chosen to study this MA to improve my programming skills - I am currently in the situation whereby I can design anything that comes into my head but I cannot build it into a working application. By the end of this course I hope to have reached a point where I am self-sufficient, so I am able to put any ideas I have into practice from start to finish. This course is also a step on my journey into a potential future career as a lecturer or tutor.</p>
