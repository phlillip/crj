    <p><strong>An attempt to fully understand the technology</strong></p>

<p>When it came to merging my prototype bmx builder in with the rest of my app, I realised I didn’t fully understand how the framework actually worked. My entire life I have avoided jQuery for the simple reason that I didn’t want to be plugging libraries in without understanding the underlying technology, so I decided to hand-build a single page application (SPA) before going back to Framework7.</p>

<p>I found an excellent youtube video tutorial <a href="#ref">[1]</a> by Curran Kelleher, demonstrating an iterative way to implement navigation for a SPA using AJAX. He provided all his code examples <a href="#ref">[2]</a> to work through along the way so I fully understood what was going on.</p>

<p>From this, I then decided to apply my long-standing idea of a stag do management app - ideal when you are abroad and don’t want to have to keep reloading pages - and built out a real test case to use for my upcoming stag do in April 2018.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>The result is https://karls.stagdo.info, a password protected, AJAX powered SPA powered by a JSON back-end! I have been waiting for years to be able to write a sentence like that and fully understand it <em>and</em> fully deserve to say it!</p>

<p>I intend to turn this into a paid service to compete with the (extremely overpriced!) competition - the likes of chillisauce and red seven leisure so I will need to build out a control panel for the organiser. I have started planning for this by dynamically creating the “stags” page from a JSON file which I can write to from the control panel:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
   "stags": [{
         "name": "stag__name",
         "nickname": "stag__nickname",
         "number": "stag__number",
         "indie": "stag__indie-outfit",
         "football": "stag__football-outfit",
         "tshirt": "stag__tshirt-size",
         "balance": "stag__debt"
      }
   ]
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<figure>
	<img src="/media/2018-04-21/stag-card.jpg" />
	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This also calculates the total amount owed to the organiser - in practice I found it very handy for everyone in the group to see who were the bad payers and how much I was owed, it certainly pulled on a few heart strings and got the money rolling in. It also provides a handy telephone link so I could phone any of the stags easily - often the organiser is dealing with people they have never met so they wouldn’t necessarily have all the phone numbers to hand.</p>

<p>My first X customers will be able to request a customisation feature which I will roll out to all future customers, to help me build up the necessary features. At first thought, I plan to provide a custom subdomain <code class="highlighter-rouge">customer.stagdo.info</code> for 1 year at a fixed price.</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Phil Penny, based in the UK. I have a solid background in design and I have chosen to study this MA to improve my programming skills - I am currently in the situation whereby I can design anything that comes into my head but I cannot build it into a working application. By the end of this course I hope to have reached a point where I am self-sufficient, so I am able to put any ideas I have into practice from start to finish. This course is also a step on my journey into a potential future career as a lecturer or tutor.</p>
