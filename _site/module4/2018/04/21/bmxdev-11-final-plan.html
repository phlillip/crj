    <p><strong>Aiming for an MVP</strong></p>

<p>I have just come through a period of complete unproductivity on this module due to starting a new full-time job and having to organise a stag do. However, I did manage to tie in my stag do preparation with the course theme, by designing and building an AJAX powered single page application to help manage the 15 stags, their questions and finances, so time was not wasted. I also designed a brand new (drinking) game which I see as a possible kickstarter campaign!</p>

<p>Moving back to the module, I have decided to take Al’s week 11 advice and plan out all the tasks I need to accomplish to achieve MVP status during the remaining 13 ( ! ) days:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Day</th>
      <th>Date</th>
      <th>AM</th>
      <th>PM</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Saturday</td>
      <td>21st</td>
      <td>Plan project</td>
      <td>Document stagdo.info</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sunday</td>
      <td>22nd</td>
      <td>Merge all work</td>
      <td>Merge all work</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Monday</td>
      <td>23rd</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>Build reward page</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tuesday</td>
      <td>24th</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>Iterate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Wednesday</td>
      <td>25th</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>Iterate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Thursday</td>
      <td>26th</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>Iterate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Friday</td>
      <td>27th</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Saturday</td>
      <td>28th</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sunday</td>
      <td>29th</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Monday</td>
      <td>30th</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tuesday</td>
      <td>1st</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>Plan video</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Wednesday</td>
      <td>2nd</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>Film video</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Thursday</td>
      <td>3rd</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>Render video</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Friday</td>
      <td>4th</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>Submission</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The final week of the project must be left as a buffer and dedicated to video creation. I am entertaining all next weekend ( birthday ) so am unable to do any work between Friday and Monday, bad timing but can’t be helped, therefore it must be planned for!</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Phil Penny, based in the UK. I have a solid background in design and I have chosen to study this MA to improve my programming skills - I am currently in the situation whereby I can design anything that comes into my head but I cannot build it into a working application. By the end of this course I hope to have reached a point where I am self-sufficient, so I am able to put any ideas I have into practice from start to finish. This course is also a step on my journey into a potential future career as a lecturer or tutor.</p>
