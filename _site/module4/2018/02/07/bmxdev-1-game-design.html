    <p><strong>This week we have been considering our favourite games of all time.</strong></p>

<p>I have played a huge amount of games in my lifetime, even considering the drought over the past ten years of “maturity”. When asked to pick a favourite, I struggled to remember them all, finding myself eager to impress and pick a hidden gem that others may not have thought of.</p>

<p>However, when searching our memories for favourites, it is not solely the game we remember, it is the moment of playing it and how it made us feel, the two are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>So perhaps we should be choosing our favourite gaming moment (or moments, for they are likely to vary wildly and be difficult to compare), rather than our favourite game. To this end I have compiled a list of my top 5 gaming moments.</p>

<p>1) Playing Super Mario 64 (and experiencing 3D) for the first time in Beatties in Merry Hill shopping centre at the age of 12.</p>

<p>2) Completing all International Superstar Soccer 64 scenarios with my pal Nigel in his bedroom during high school.</p>

<p>3) Playing Gran Turismo on Playstation with my Father until 4am on many occasions experimenting with in-depth car tuning and marvelling at the “photorealistic” graphics.</p>

<p>4) Watching my big sister play Gronks on our Tatung Einstein and enjoying the sound effects at a young age.</p>

<p>5) Playing co-op Snake Rattle’n’Roll on the NES with my big sister and falling out again and again.</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Phil Penny, based in the UK. I have a solid background in design and I have chosen to study this MA to improve my programming skills - I am currently in the situation whereby I can design anything that comes into my head but I cannot build it into a working application. By the end of this course I hope to have reached a point where I am self-sufficient, so I am able to put any ideas I have into practice from start to finish. This course is also a step on my journey into a potential future career as a lecturer or tutor.</p>

<p>You can view some of my previous work at <a href="http://philpenny.co.uk">philpenny.co.uk</a> or check out my personal blog at <a href="http://naturamohican.com">naturalmohican.com</a></p>
