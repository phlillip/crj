    <p><strong>Create an interactive novel using Ren’Py, loosely based on the game creation activity from Week 2. There must be at least three interactive moments within the novel.</strong></p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>Using my previous game concept as a base, I chose to create a flow diagram to help me understand the necessary choices and content for my novel:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/media/2018-02-10/vaporwave__process-flow.jpg" />
	<figcaption>
		Flow diagram for vaporwave.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The 3 main choices in the game are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose music to use with the app - this either ends the game immediately (bad ending) or allows you to carry on.</li>
  <li>Choose which type of surfboard - this gives you two distinct story paths. The longboard is the only way to the good ending, whie the shortboard gives you two variations of the sad ending.</li>
</ol>

<p>Shortboard path</p>

<ol>
  <li>Allow fan to take a selfie - sad ending.</li>
  <li>Don;t allow fan to take a selfie - sad ending with additional sadness.</li>
</ol>

<p>Longboard path</p>

<ol>
  <li>Don’t save the animals - leads you to an OK ending.</li>
  <li>Save the animals - leads you to the good ending.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>I spent a couple of hours getting to grips with Ren’Py, playing with various settings and trying to incorporate as many features as I could into my story. Here is the screencast of the first version:</p>

<video src="/media/2018-02-10/vaporwave_screencast--1.mp4" controls="">
Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, 
but don't worry, you can <a href="/media/SMRT.mp4">download it</a>
and watch it with your favorite video player!
</video>

<h3 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h3>

<p>Obviously this was an exercise in getting to grips with the technology and the logic behind it all, however my script writing needs serious work. The script, together with the graphics and sound are base-level placeholders in this instance.</p>

<p>I will seek out further information regarding copyright; imagery can be created by myself, however the use of music downloaded free from the internet needs careful consideration.</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Phil Penny, based in the UK. I have a solid background in design and I have chosen to study this MA to improve my programming skills - I am currently in the situation whereby I can design anything that comes into my head but I cannot build it into a working application. By the end of this course I hope to have reached a point where I am self-sufficient, so I am able to put any ideas I have into practice from start to finish. This course is also a step on my journey into a potential future career as a lecturer or tutor.</p>

<p>You can view some of my previous work at <a href="http://philpenny.co.uk">philpenny.co.uk</a> or check out my personal blog at <a href="http://naturamohican.com">naturalmohican.com</a></p>
