    <p><strong>Video editing is yet another skill required by the indie developer.</strong></p>

<p>I chose Blender for my video editing, since it is free, open source software (FOSS) and has a strong support community along with all the professional features we will need. That was an easy choice; understanding video editing and learning the software is a whole different ballgame.</p>

<p>Luckily I have a basic understanding of film technqiues thanks to studying a module of cinematography at university. This enabled me to understand the importance of rhythm &amp; pacing, cuts, camera positioning and that oh so common technique of <em>juxtaposition</em>.</p>

<p>However I still faced a steep learning curve with Blender controls, thankfully the excellent <strong>Mikeycal Meyers</strong> has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjyuVPBuorqIhlqZtoIvnAVQ3x18sNev4">fantastic YouTube playlist</a> covering the entire process.</p>

<p>Having completed the videos, I now know not to underestimate the time it takes to properly plan and complete the process of video editing. Blender is an excellent tool, the only drawback I have found is with the ability to add text to frames—it is possible but very limited, so I preferred to render out the text as images in a separate graphics program instead.</p>

<p>The value of planning in a “buffer” prior to a deadline has proven to be worth it’s weight in gold. We allocated a whole week spare—and it turned out that learning the video editing process and communicating the correct footage I needed from Carl actually took an extra week.</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Phil Penny, based in the UK. I have a solid background in design and I have chosen to study this MA to improve my programming skills - I am currently in the situation whereby I can design anything that comes into my head but I cannot build it into a working application. By the end of this course I hope to have reached a point where I am self-sufficient, so I am able to put any ideas I have into practice from start to finish. This course is also a step on my journey into a potential future career as a lecturer or tutor.</p>

<p>You can view some of my previous work at <a href="http://philpenny.co.uk">philpenny.co.uk</a> or check out my personal blog at <a href="http://naturamohican.com">naturalmohican.com</a></p>
