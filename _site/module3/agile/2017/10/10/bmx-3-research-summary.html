    <p><strong>What follows is a summary of my research to date.</strong></p>

<p>###The competition</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hlf.org.uk/">The Heritage Lottery Fund</a> accepts applications nationwide, and has a wide variety of grants and funding schemes. I need to find out the type of application Redditch Borough Council is planning on making, to understand more about what needs to be highlighted. One immediate takeaway is the focus on <em>heritage</em> in all support schemes.</p>

<p>###Similar products</p>

<p>###Users</p>

<p>In my meeting with Jackie we spoke about making the area as open and welcoming as possible, to encourage families to bring their children. The close proximity of the new BMX track already pulls in a subset of users that would easily identify as users of the pump track, but this would also extend to the younger, less experienced riders and general public. Health and safety regulations also need to be considered.</p>

<p>###Features</p>

<p>A <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">progressive web app</a> appears to be a logical route to take to deliver an economic and wide-reaching solution. It also ties in with my current skillset, so lends itself to faster development times.</p>

<p>An initial analysis into the use of augmented reality with progressive web apps has proved positive; with just two caveats to consider:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Further investigation ito <em>markerless</em> AR needs to be done to enable GPS-based AR.</li>
  <li><a href="http://caniuse.com/rtcpeerconnection/embed/">Certain browsers</a> are unable to take advantage of the technology. An approximation would deem this to be around 35% of web browsers, or a third. More analysis is needed.</li>
</ol>

<p>###Costings</p>

<p>The only budget involed here is my time; up to 12 weeks of university study during the module, plus some additional voluntary time available in Q1 of 2018 to help further improve the proposal.</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Phil Penny, based in the UK. I have a solid background in design and I have chosen to study this MA to improve my programming skills - I am currently in the situation whereby I can design anything that comes into my head but I cannot build it into a working application. By the end of this course I hope to have reached a point where I am self-sufficient, so I am able to put any ideas I have into practice from start to finish. This course is also a step on my journey into a potential future career as a lecturer or tutor.</p>

<p>You can view some of my previous work at <a href="http://philpenny.co.uk">philpenny.co.uk</a> or check out my personal blog at <a href="http://naturamohican.com">naturalmohican.com</a></p>
