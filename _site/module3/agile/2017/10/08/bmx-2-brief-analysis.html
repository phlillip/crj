    <p><strong>A detailed analysis of the brief will allow me to direct my research into the most effective areas ( <a href="/media/2017-10-08/Redditch Pump Track Design Brief.pdf">Read the approved brief</a> ) .</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Form part of a local council bid to Heritage Lottery Fund (and potentially Sport England)…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Needs to be compatible with council processes and reflect the organisation in the right manner. Analysing the councils’ previous bid applications will allow me to understand the approach I need to take to be able to communicate my ideas as internal ones.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…to invest in the regeneration of the surrounding area (approximately 35km2 ) into a “wheeled hub”…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consideration must be taken into account of the immediate surrounding area, and the councils’ plans for regeneration as part of a larger project. Anything I propose will only be one part of the bidding process; it should fit in with the family of ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…by proposing sensitive, sustainable solutions for the original pump track…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A key point highlighted by Jackie; the council do not have the resources to manage a high maintenance pump track once it has been finished, so any proposals must demonstrate sustainability. In addition, the area is managed between a split labour/conservative rule, so there is a certain sensitivity needed with any proposals to allow for smoother decision making.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…and increase community involvement within the area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is first and foremost a site for the general public. Anything that can be done to engage the local community is a great thing for Redditch. Initial thoughts are based around community maintenance, community-led events, and an open, welcoming aura to the site.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inform visitors about the heritage and history behind the original pump track,…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jackie—like the vast majority of Redditch citizens—was unaware of the heritage behind the original pump track. This would provide a major advantage in the bidding process, so it needs to be taken advantage of.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…delivering contextual information directly to the visitor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The proposal should offer something different to visitors whilst they are at the site, in line with their possible interests or current situation. For example, visitors sat in a spectator area might be delivered historical archive footage of races on the original track, whilst those on the track might receive technical data about the layout and obstacles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Allow visitors to interact with the environment using their own mobile devices. This might be through iBeacons or other custom hardware.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This feature would increase footfall in the area, which in turn may help to generate revenue and community involvement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We need to deliver options for high quality design specifications for regeneration of the pump track, focused on the heritage of the site. There is also the opportunity to continue working on the project after the module with the aim of attaining funding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The application for funding will not be presented until Q2 2018, so there is a period of time in which to improve anything presented during the module timeline.</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Phil Penny, based in the UK. I have a solid background in design and I have chosen to study this MA to improve my programming skills - I am currently in the situation whereby I can design anything that comes into my head but I cannot build it into a working application. By the end of this course I hope to have reached a point where I am self-sufficient, so I am able to put any ideas I have into practice from start to finish. This course is also a step on my journey into a potential future career as a lecturer or tutor.</p>

<p>You can view some of my previous work at <a href="http://philpenny.co.uk">philpenny.co.uk</a> or check out my personal blog at <a href="http://naturamohican.com">naturalmohican.com</a></p>
