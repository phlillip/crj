    <p><strong>Target - create app functionality</strong></p>

<p>My SMART goal this week was far too big, so unsurprisingly I didn’t manage to complete it. I devoted many hours to the application, building up the functionality step by step, but having a working app already meant I didn’t follow my user stories as well as I should, to the extent that I actually created additional functionality before completing all the basic goals.</p>

<hr />
<p>Again I had <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42841321/return-id-of-button-when-clicked-kivy-python">help from Stack Overflow</a> and I have to admit that I don’t fully understand the solution, but I did manage to apply it to my application and that is good enough for me for now. It is difficult learning Python &amp; Kivy at the same time, they are essentially two different languages that need to be applied in their own way. I don’t think I will fully get a grasp of the best way to build until I have completed a few more applications in different areas, perhaps a game app would be useful to improve my understanding.</p>

<p>Yet again I have failed to produce design mockups—this is due to the huge number of hours I ploughed into coding this week. However, the goal in the 4th week is to beautify the app so I will definitely need some visuals to aim for. My user stories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As the purchaser, I want the app to look professional and uniform throughout so I feel like I am buying a quality product.</li>
  <li>As the manager, I want to know where I am in the app so I can quickly and easily navigate to different areas without missing the game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Phil Penny, based in the UK. I have a solid background in design and I have chosen to study this MA to improve my programming skills - I am currently in the situation whereby I can design anything that comes into my head but I cannot build it into a working application. By the end of this course I hope to have reached a point where I am self-sufficient, so I am able to put any ideas I have into practice from start to finish. This course is also a step on my journey into a potential future career as a lecturer or tutor.</p>
